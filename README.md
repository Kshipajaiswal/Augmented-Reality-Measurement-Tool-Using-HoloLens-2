## Tools & Technologies

- **Fusion 360** â€“ For 3D modeling of the chisel tool.
- **3D Printing** â€“ Physical fabrication of the tool prototype.
- **Unity Hub + Unity 3D** â€“ To build AR experiences and import CAD models.
- **Microsoft HoloLens 2** â€“ For real-time visualization and interaction.
- **Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)** â€“ To handle interactions (zoom, rotate, drag) on HoloLens.

## Key Features

- Designed and 3D-printed a custom chisel for gap testing in machine assemblies.
- Projected 3D CAD models onto physical space using HoloLens 2.
- Allowed users to interact with modelsâ€”zoom, rotate, and inspect components with gestures.
- Enhanced precision and usability in mechanical validation workflows.

## Use Case

This tool helps engineers during the design review phase by letting them visualize and validate spatial tolerances and part fits using an AR overlay. It eliminates the need for screen-based CAD checks and enables immersive inspections on the factory floor.

## How to Run (HoloLens)

1. Open the Unity project using Unity Hub (ensure MRTK is installed).
2. Connect and configure HoloLens 2 in Developer Mode.
3. Build the Unity scene to UWP platform.
4. Deploy the solution using Visual Studio.
5. Launch the app on HoloLens to interact with the imported CAD models.

## Future Scope

- Integrate real-time gap measurement data using IoT sensors.
- Add voice control and gesture tutorials for smoother interaction.
- Enable live collaboration between multiple HoloLens users.
- Explore AI-assisted part recognition for inspection.
